# Best Practices

## Description
This repository will be used to demonstrate various coding best-practices we covered in CSCI7000 at CU Boulder.
The program `get_column_stats.py` takes in a data file with tab separated rows and column and returns the mean and average of a specified row.
The program `style.py` is mostly just a demonstration file for the general PEP8 style, with no significant output.

## Usage

To run the `get_column_stats.py` script in this packge, make sure you have Python 3.x and run :

```
python get_column_stats.py --filename [data_file] --col_number [column_number]
```

Where `[data_file]` is the name of the file you would like to analyze and `[column_number]` is the column in that file you would like to analyze.

## Installation

Since these python scripts are interpreted by your computers python, there are no major installation scripts.
